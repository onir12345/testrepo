## Prerequisites

It would be nice if you know what `kubectl` is and have a basic understanding of running conatiners with docker / containerd or cri-o.

## Preparation

To get prepared please install the `kubernetes cli` & `setup cluster` in your env from [**HERE**](https://gist.github.com/NotHarshhaa/854ed5c12fff07acde88faf95b9decff) and make sure to have bash completion for kubectl in place

## Kubernetes  Guides

### Networking

The purpose of [this website](https://www.tkng.io/) is to provide an overview of various Kubernetes networking components with a specific focus on exactly how they implement the required functionality.

The guide is split into multiple parts which can be studied mostly independently, however they all work together to provide a complete end-to-end cluster network abstractions.

Where possible, every topic in this guide will include a dedicated [hands-on labs](https://www.tkng.io/lab/) which can be spun up locally in a matter of minutes. 

### Security
 
The Security checklist aims at providing a basic list of guidance with links to more comprehensive documentation on each topic. It does not claim to be exhaustive and is meant to evolve.
